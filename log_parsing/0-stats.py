Log Parsing Script

This script reads log entries from stdin line by line and computes metrics:
- Total file size from all log entries
- Count of HTTP status codes (200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 500)

After every 10 lines of input or upon
receiving a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl + C),
it prints the following statistics:
- Total file size: the sum of all file sizes from the log entries
- Number of lines per status code: only valid status codes are counted and
  printed in ascending order.

Input format expected for each log entry:
<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>

Example usage:
$ ./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
